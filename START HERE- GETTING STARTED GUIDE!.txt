The purpose of this project is to kickstart any new projects with a comon environment for our dev team so we can jump right in and start developing.

this project should address the following needs:
	Package management
	Bundling
	Minification
	Sourcemaps
	Transpiling
	Dynamic HTML Generation
	Centralized HTTP
	Mock API framework
	Common Libraries
	Dev web server
	Linting
	Automated Testing
	Continuous Integration
	Automated Build
	Automated Deployment
	Working Example App

Common editor environment settings (requires plugin for atom and vsCode)
*	https://editorconfig.org/

THINGS TO CONSIDER FOR FUTURE PROJECTS:
	Sharing development work outside a local network: localtunel, ngrok, now, Surge
		-note: these would be great tools to leverage if you dont need to hit an api or if that api does not care about where the requests are originating from (cors security)

	gulp vs npmScripts
		- gulp plugins are typically abstractions of npm packages. (if there is a bug in eslint, you would have to wait for esling to be updated and then gulp-eslint to be updated as well.)
		- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-left-gulp-and-grunt-for-npm-scripts-3d6853dd22b8

*	npmScripts notes:
		- all defined tasks can also have "pre" and "post" hooks. so for instance, you create a script with the tag "start" if you define another script with the tag "prestart". When you run "npm start" the prescript will execute first
		- example: npm start -s (silent mode, will get significantly less output to the console. at the minimum this removes the echoed command output that would normally show)

TRANSPILING: Allows you to use the latest version of JS (ES6 or greater) and this code will be transpiled down to ES5 for environments that dont yet support the newest versions of JS (like IE...)
	(this tabel illustrates why we should transpile https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/ specifically the IE11 column)
	Typescript vs Babel
		Typescript: enhanced autocomplete, enhanced readability, safer refactoring, additional non-standard features (interfaces)
*		Babel: write standardized js, leverage full JS Ecosystem, use experimental features earlier, no type defs or annotations required
		NOTE: The Code and Build Scripts in this project are transplied with Babel

BUNDLING:
	module formats: AMD, CommonJS,UMD, ES6Modules, IIFE (immediately invoked function expressions)
*		ES6 MODULES should be considered the preferred method for encapsulating our code
			WHY? It's standardized
				 It's statically analyzable
				 	-improved auto complete
					-intelligent refactoring
					-fails fast
					-tree shaking (identifying unused code that can be eliminated)
				 It's easy to read
					-named "imports"
					-default "exports"
	bundlers: bundle code into a single minified file
		-Browserify, Webpack, Rollup, JSPM
*		WEBPACK should be considered the preferred method although rollup is gaining support in the community
			Why: Bundle splitting (deliver portions of js that only relate to the page you're loading)
				Hot Module Reloading (make a change and it auto reloaded in place without refreshing the page?)
				Tree Shaking
			Note: webpack does not generate any physical files, it serves from memory.
*				ALSO - Check out Webpack Fundamentals by Joe Eames on pluralsight for a deep dive

SOURCEMAPS: for debugging transpiled and bundled code
	-maps code back to original source
	-generate them as part of the build
	-only downloaded when the user opens the developer tools!
	-to set breakpoints open up the dev tools and on the left sidebar there should be a tree item for the website and one for webpack. expand webpack and you should see all the original js code.

LINTING
	-ESLInt
		-check out eslint plugins like eslint-plugin-angular
		-also look at http://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint  it's a good resource for everything eslint
		-file watching: eslint-watch npm package to relint code and can be run via an npm script example: "esw webpack.config.* src buildscripts" This calls eslint watch and lints the webpack files everything in source/ and everything in buildScripts/
		-!NOTE: does not lint experimental features(this is not likely to be a problem unless we start leveraging bleeding edge features of JS)

TESTING (automated-unit)
    -6 key decisions
        -framework
**          -Mocha
*           -Jasmine
            -Tape
            -QUnit
            -AVA
*           -Jest
        -assertion library (declare what you expect: expect(4+2).to.equal(4))
*           -chai
            -should.js
            -expect
        -helper Libraries
            -JSDOM -run dom related tests without a browser
            -cheerio - query virtual DOM using jQuery selectors
        -where to run tests
            -Browser - Karma, Testem (more overhead because you have to set them up)
            -headless browser - PhantomJS
*           -In-memory DOM - JSDOM (lighter weight than phantomJS)
        -where to place tests
            -Centralized
*           -Alongside - system.js & system.spec.js in the same folder
        -when to run tests
            -run everytime you hit save
